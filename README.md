1. Understanding the Problem:
Spam emails are unwanted messages that often contain advertisements, fraud attempts, or phishing links. Automatically classifying emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) is crucial to improving email security.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify emails into two categories:

*)Spam – Unwanted promotional or fraudulent emails.

*)Ham – Legitimate, important messages.

2. Steps Involved in the Model
Step 1: Loading the Dataset
The dataset is usually a CSV file containing emails and their corresponding labels (spam or ham). Each row represents an email with two columns:

*)Message: The actual email content.

*)Label: The classification (spam or ham).
We use the pandas library to read and manage this data. 

Step 2: Preprocessing the Data
Since email messages are textual data, they need to be converted into a format that machine learning models can understand. This involves:

*)Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "is", "and").

*)Tokenizing text (breaking it into words).

*)Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

We use TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text for this transformation.

Step 3: Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
*)The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. This helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Step 4: Training the Model
*)For classification, we use Naïve Bayes, a popular algorithm for text-based classification tasks. It works well with probabilistic word distribution in text data.

Step 5: Evaluating the Model
*)Once trained, the model is tested on the remaining dataset. Metrics used for evaluation include:

i)Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of predictions.

ii)Precision: Measures how many emails classified as spam were actually spam.

iii)Recall: Measures how well the model identifies all spam messages.

iv)F1-score: A balance between precision and recall.
